# iris-ml-classification

This is my first ML project made following James Brownlee tutorial. The program was made for the classfication of Iris Flowers using Machine Learning, going through all the steps of the process for Educational Purpose.

## Motivation
It was my first ML experience since i started learning data science and python. Even though it is simple and i was heavily based on a tutorial, the value of practical learning is indispensable for me as a beginner in a new area.

## These are the beatiful Iris Flower or Lírio, for brazilians!

All packages and libraries are described in the notebook.

## Credits
**This program was heavily based on James Brownlee tutorial that can be found [here 
](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/). So all credits should go for him and it's amazing website**
